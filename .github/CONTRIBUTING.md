# Contributing

:balloon: First off, thank you for considering contributing to exist-markdown. :balloon:

All pull-requests are welcome. File a bug report, fix a typo, improve the documentation, or add a new feature. All are helpful, and make exist-markdown better.

Please have a quick look at these guidelines to help both you and the developers to keep things moving smoothly.

## Basic Conduct

*   Please be respectful when discussing changes and issues. Consider that not everyone's first language is english.
*   Create an issue for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.

If this is your first time contributing to a project you might want to take a look [here](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Getting started
1.  Create your own fork of the code.

2.  Do the changes in your fork.
    *   Minor changes that don't impact code functionality (typos, inline comments, â€¦ ) can be done in the master branch.
    *   Functional changes should be collected in their own branch.

3.  If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    *   Open a pull request referencing the issue describing the new feature in the comment section \([how-to](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)\).  

Once your pull request has been reviewed it will be merged. You can greatly help the reviewer by:
*   sticking to one feature per pull request.
*   use [meaningful](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) commit messages inside your feature branch.
*   filling out the pull request & issue templates.
